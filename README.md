# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Coupled with it's beautifully modern UI, any user is bound to have a memorable user experience.

# Final Product

Once clone and ran, this is what you can expect to see. At the top we have a fixed navbar that will remain in view even while scrolling. On the left you have a profile picture of  yourself and your name. On the right you have a textfield to enter and submit a new tweet! And just below that you'll be able to read every previous posters tweets as long as how many days ago the tweet was made.

If you came for the sole purpose of reading tweets you may toggle the form out of view by clicking on "Write a new tweet". If while reading tweets you become inspired to write your own piece of literature you may press "Write a new tweet" again to bring it back into view. Just make sure it's between 0-140 characters or you will be yelled at in the form of an error message which will slide down (with the help of jQuery).
